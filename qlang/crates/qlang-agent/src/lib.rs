//! QLANG Agent Interface — AI-to-AI graph communication
//!
//! This crate provides the interface for AI agents to:
//! - Emit QLANG graphs (structured decisions, not text)
//! - Receive and interpret QLANG graphs
//! - Compose graphs from sub-graphs
//!
//! The key insight: instead of generating code as text (token by token),
//! an AI agent makes structured decisions:
//!   1. Choose a node type (from catalog)
//!   2. Choose an operation (from catalog)
//!   3. Wire inputs (select edges)
//!   4. Set constraints (from catalog)
//!
//! 4 decisions instead of 47 tokens. Each decision is valid by construction.
